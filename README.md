# Introduction:
Our Sign Language Project aims to help people communicate better by translating sign language gestures into text in real time.

## About the project:
We're using machine learning and computer vision techniques to create a simple system that lets people easily understand sign language.

## Motivation:
We want to make communication easier for everyone, especially for those with hearing impairments. This project is driven by our desire to create a more inclusive and accessible world.
